Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Describe fake MFRC522 device in Versatile PB device tree
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Use the I2C bus to "hide" our fake device, and not the SPI bus,
because the latter is part of the AMBA bus and not supported
by QEMU, as described here: https://patchwork.openembedded.org/patch/130741/
