# Register map

MFRC522_CMDREG              0x01
    starts and stops command execution

    MFRC522_CMDREG_CMD          0x0F
        activates a command based on the Command value
        reading this register shows which command is executed

    MFRC522_CMDREG_SOFTPWRDOWN  0x10
        Soft power-down mode entered

    MFRC522_CMDREG_RCVOFF       0x20
        analog part of the receiver is switched off


MFRC522_FIFODATAREG         0x09
    input and output of 64 byte FIFO buffer


MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG        0x0A
    number of bytes stored in the FIFO buffer

    MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG_LEVEL  0x7F
        indicates the number of bytes stored in the FIFO buffer
        writing to the FIFODataReg register increments and reading decrements
        the FIFOLevel value

    MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG_FLUSH  0x80
        immediately clears the internal FIFO buffer’s read and write pointer and
        ErrorReg register’s BufferOvfl bit
        reading this bit always returns 0

# Command set
MFRC522_IDLE                0x0
    no action, cancels current command execution

MFRC522_MEM                 0x1
    stores 25 bytes into the internal buffer

MFRC522_GENERATERANDOMID    0x2
    generates a 10-byte random ID number

MFRC522_NOCMDCHANGE         0x7
    no command change, can be used to modify the CommandReg register bits
    without affecting the command, for example, the PowerDown bit

MFRC522_SOFTRESET           0xF
    resets the MFRC522
